  <h1 style="color:bisque">Europa</h1>
  <h2 style="color:white">
A lonely astronaut out on Europa<br>
Silently praying for a quick toke of<br>
Something deadly enough<br>
To take him home<br>
Or at least<br>
Somewhere far from everything he knows<br>
That his life's just a shadow of a cloud<br>
Where everybody looks up<br>
And he looks down<br>
All his space buddies dead and gone<br>
Nobody left to watch with him<br>
The break of dawn<br>
The ice is harsh<br>
It burns his feet<br>
And yet he'd rather stay<br>
Within the cold, unfeeling cell<br>
He built to keep him safe<br>
When a shooting star goes by<br>
He runs back to his cave<br>
But secretly he hopes<br>
That one might decide to stay<br>
Sometimes it's hard to be so alone<br>
And yet, it's the only thing<br>
He's ever known<br>
He doesn't know why he pushes them away<br>
I guess when they're that deep<br>
Some scars never fade<br>
He doesn't hope for much these days<br>
Would you?<br>
If you spent them crying<br>
On a lonely moon</h2>
