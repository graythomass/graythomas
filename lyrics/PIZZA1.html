  <h1 style="color:bisque">Something Old and Nameless</h1>
  <h2 style="color:white">
We must be back to back, you and me<br>
With something old and nameless<br>
Stuck right between<br>
And I’m blameless<br>

My tongue is chained<br>
To something you don’t perceive<br>
And it took me<br>
Said go back home now<br>
You don’t live here anymore<br>
Now you’re nameless<br>

Bright eyes darken and sink into your skull<br>
Like the lies I built for you<br>
Call them forces outside of my control<br>
That’s bullshit<br>

We were on the path, you and me<br>
Couldn’t sniff out what came between<br>
So I dug through<br>
Disgusting memories<br>
Until I found what ate at me<br>
I was silenced<br>

Green eyes redden, no fanfare for the queen<br>
Just hateful melodies<br>
Though they’re beautiful, undeniably<br>
They’re bullshit<br>
