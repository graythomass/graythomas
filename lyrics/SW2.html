  <h1 style="color:white">Wishing the Days Away</h1>
  <h2 style="color:bisque">
Friend of mine<br>
Tried to warn me one day<br>
She said somebody would come along<br>
And take my innocence away<br>
They'd show you all their love<br>
And then they'd leave you feeling gray<br>
And what for<br>
Well no more<br>
Than just a heart to put up<br>
On the shelf<br>
A testament to their health<br>
A toast to wealth<br>
A taste of Bordeaux<br>
Man I don't know<br>
But don't go<br>
And I did<br>
So now I<br>
Find myself<br>
Wishing the time away again<br>
Trying to find the things<br>
That used to make me grin<br>
Oh, I never win<br>
But ain't it a sin<br>
To wish the days away<br>
Spreading my hope too thin<br>
I met an old friend the other day<br>
He said his luck had turned<br>
And all the clouds all went away<br>
He thought his love was real<br>
And he'd never be led astray<br>
But he saw the doubt in my eyes<br>
He said don't worry about the flies<br>
Man, someday you're going to<br>
Find a prize<br>
Of your own<br>
Don't lose hope<br>
But I did<br>
So now I<br>
Find myself<br>
Wishing the time away again<br>
Trying to find the things<br>
That used to make me grin<br>
Oh I never win<br>
But ain't it a sin<br>
To wish the days away<br>
Spreading my hope too thin<br>
But someday I'm gonna run out<br>
Yeah, someday it's gonna run out<br>
And I'm gonna wish I hadn't<br>
Asked it to<br>
Someday you're gonna run out<br>
Yeah, someday your time will run out<br>
And you're gonna wish you hadn't<br>
Asked it to</h2>
