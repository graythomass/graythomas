  <h2 style="color:white">
I know why, I know what for<br>
But I don't know where you are now<br>
You just went, you wouldn't say<br>
And I wish you would have stayed<br>
But I know, that you can't<br>
That's okay, yeah that's your choice<br>
You're not first, you won't be last<br>
You're just an extra in the cast<br>
Set the stage, made up face<br>
Another's gonna take your place<br>
That's okay, hey that's your choice<br>
But you better speak up<br>
'Cause I can't hear your pretty voice<br>
Way up here<br>
What did you want from me<br>
And did you get it<br>
Raise those curtains and we'll see<br>
The actress playing<br>
Someone that I thought<br>
Cared about me<br>
But people who care<br>
Don't leave<br>
If we meet again someday<br>
Probably won't, but let's just say<br>
I hope you turn and walk away<br>
'Cause I don't know if I could<br>
Control my speech<br>
Say a few choice words<br>
Ask you why you rebuilt my world<br>
If you only wanna watch it crumble<br>
Man I don't know how you act so humble<br>
When you commit these acts<br>
And against all odds<br>
Still have me wishing that you'd come back<br>
Well what did you want from me<br>
And did you get it<br>
I'll raise those curtains and we'll see<br>
The actress playing<br>
Someone that I thought<br>
Cared about me<br>
But people who care<br>
Don't leave<br>
Yeah what did you want from me<br>
And did you get it<br>
I'll raise those curtains and we'll see<br>
The actress playing<br>
Aw, the actress is playing again</h2>
