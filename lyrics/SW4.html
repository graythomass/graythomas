  <h1 style="color:white">Regret to Regret</h1>
  <h2 style="color:bisque">
Had to hide the blanket<br>
That she laid on<br>
'Cause my parents know<br>
I don't smoke<br>
Had to sneak her 'round my place<br>
I just don't want them to know<br>

Would have liked to wear<br>
The gifts she me<br>
And I probably should have<br>
Called her baby<br>
Looking back I had<br>
So much more to give<br>
But that's just the way that I live<br>

Live from regret to regret<br>
Placing my bets<br>
Then jumping out the window<br>
I don't answer to no one<br>
Not even myself<br>
And I'm cool with that<br>

Now she dropped out<br>
And moved out<br>
And I haven't seen her since<br>
Wonder if I'll run into her<br>
Out skating again<br>
But if I did<br>
What would it mean<br>
She's been out living<br>
And I'm just a machine<br>
Lay off the booze, man<br>
Try not to lose<br>
What I haven't yet driven away<br>

With my lackluster affections<br>
Daily obsessions<br>
That leave me<br>
Before they can come to conclusions<br>
I wish I could shake this illusion<br>
That I'm meant to be more than a loser<br>

Live from regret to regret<br>
Placing my bets<br>
Then jumping out the window<br>
I don't answer to no one<br>
Not even myself<br>
And I'm cool with that<br>

'Cause changing is hard<br>
And I'm way too old<br>
To be a better friend to myself<br>
So I'll just keep on wasting<br>
My beautiful days<br>
Until I have no one else<br>
I live from regret to regret<br>
Placing my bets<br>
Then jumping out the window<br>
I don't answer to no one<br>
Not even myself<br>
And I'm cool with that<br>
Yeah, I'm cool with that</h2>
