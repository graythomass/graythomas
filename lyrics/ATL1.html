  <h1 style="color:bisque">End of Times</h1>
  <h2 style="color:white">
Having taken a step back<br>
From the end of times<br>
And looked at the situation<br>
With well-rested eyes<br>
I can see that we lived<br>
Under not so blue skies<br>
So I see no reason<br>
To continue to cry<br>
(That being said)<br>
Wave away your right<br>
To be a rational person<br>
Dream of all the places<br>
We could be together<br>
Standing there forever<br>
Everything in line until<br>
The end of times<br>
Let me see into your life<br>
And feel your fear<br>
And hear your lies<br>
And be the one to tell you<br>
When time has flown by<br>
And we need to slow down<br>
Or we may never<br>
Return to the ground<br>
And when the end of times<br>
Finally rolls around<br>
We won't need to feel<br>
Like we didn't get around<br>
When we're old and can't<br>
Remember all we did<br>
We'll have each other<br>
To remind the other<br>
That we did<br>
Some people scream<br>
And scream all day<br>
With surprisingly little to say<br>
But not me, no<br>
I save my words<br>
In a bottle up my sleeve<br>
And I don't just give them away<br>
Or hold them up<br>
For a rainy day<br>
I give them all to you<br>
Just for you<br>
(well, maybe a little<br>
For the songs, too)<br>
And when the end of times<br>
Finally rolls around<br>
We won't need to feel<br>
Like we didn't get around<br>
When we're old and can't<br>
Remember all we did<br>
We'll have each other<br>
To remind the other<br>
That we did<br>
That we did<br>
That we did</h2>
