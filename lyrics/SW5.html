  <h1 style="color:bisque">Life's a Melody</h1>
  <h2 style="color:white">
Listen to the radio<br>
When I'm driving around<br>
Just admiring the scenery<br>
I roll the window down<br>
And start my usual dreaming of<br>
A life that would be so care free<br>

I wanna be a rocker<br>
But I'm not that tall<br>
I wanna be R&B<br>
But I got no soul<br>
I got a guitar<br>
And a voice that goes<br>

So I'll tell a few lies<br>
Make up a love story<br>
Turn my life into a melody<br>
I'll write a couple verses<br>
Stave off the hearses<br>
And live my symphony<br>

The dream state fades<br>
And I return to my charade<br>
Picking up the pieces<br>
Of the life made<br>
Park the car<br>
Hit the bar<br>
Put some pennies in the jar<br>
And listen to the guitar man sing<br>

He makes me want to<br>
Be a pop singer<br>
But my life's a bore, well<br>
I'd be a songwriter<br>
But I got no lore<br>
I'll hop in the car<br>
Put a CD in<br>
And hear somebody else soar<br>

While they tell a few lies<br>
Make up a love story<br>
Turn their life into a melody<br>
They'll write a couple verses<br>
Stave off the hearses<br>
And live their symphony<br>

Yeah they'll tell a few lies<br>
Make up a love story, and oh<br>
What a beautiful melody</h2>
