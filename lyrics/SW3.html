  <h1 style="color:bisque">Think Away</h1>
  <h2 style="color:white">
Goodbye<br>
To the fair<br>
To your hair<br>
Flashed gold in the air<br>
Were we really there?<br>
Cheeks lit up pink<br>
No memory, just paper and ink<br>
No feelings persist<br>
Forever<br>
Couldn't stay there<br>
In heaven<br>
So why stay in hell?<br>
I'm finally<br>
Tearing down the part<br>
That I couldn't think away<br>
I could only put them away<br>
For a while<br>
But what good are memories<br>
No longer in my mind<br>
I'm ripping up the pictures<br>
A little late<br>
But in good enough time<br>
Shouldn't I know what's good for me<br>
Why do I keep reliving, reviving<br>
What I know I need to leave<br>
Behind<br>
Am I removing all my reminders<br>
Or am I just throwing up new blinders<br>
And is there a difference<br>
At all<br>
I think I need to start<br>
Tearing down the parts<br>
That I couldn't think away<br>
I could only put them away<br>
For a while<br>
I'm ripping up the pictures<br>
A little late<br>
But in good enough time<br>
Goodbye<br>
To your smile<br>
Goodbye<br>
To your friends<br>
Goodbye</h2>
